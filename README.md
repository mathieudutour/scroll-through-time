# scroll-through-time

Two fingers (horizontal) scroll moves through time instead of space in [Atom](https://atom.io/)

![demo](https://github.com/mathieudutour/scroll-through-time/raw/master/screencast.gif)

## Installation

```
apm install scroll-through-time
```

## Why?
If used with software that could keep up, a scroll wheel mapped to send a stream of 'undo' and 'redo' events could be kind of cool.
